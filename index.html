                <p class="introTxt"> It's a warm summer evening. The sun won't set for another 2 hours, and you're relaxing on your couch with your pet beside you. You're watching your evening soap opera and an emergency broadcast appears on the screen. "ALERT! Contamination Outbreak, seek shelter IMMEDIETLY!!" You laugh it off at first. It's probably a trick from the TV network. That's probably illegal though. :/ It's not until you get texts from your closest friends and family asking you if you're safe that it starts to set in. You need to take initiative, and fast. What do you do first? </p>

                    <p class="fortifyTxt"> You take your tool box and head outside, with your pet right beside you. All you have is thin ply wood in your shed. You start nailing them to the windows and doors and put barbed wire around your property. You're not sure if you're sufficiently protected, but it's all you have. As you're settling1 in, waiting for the worst, you notice something's missing.You left your pet outside! You hear their tiny whimpers from across your yard. But the sun is setting, and a mob of zombies is headed up your road. You have to make a choice. </p>

                        You can't bear leaving them outside. You start unnailing the wood on the front door and sneakily run and scoop up your pet. Thankfully, the zombies don't seem to notice. You safely make it back into your home and watch the mob walk right past you. You and your pet are able to wait out the outbreak until a rescue helicopter comes to save you.</p>

                    <p class="leaveThemTxt"> As much as you want to, you can't risk anything. You're really not trying to die. You leave to your bedroom to escape the sound of your pet's sad screams and the sound of the mob. You expect them to pass you and the sounds to dissipate, but you realize the sounds are getting closer. Your pets screams has drawn the mob towards your home, and they're now tearing through your windows. I guess the wood didn't do much lol. </p>
                    <p class="badEnding"> You are unable to hide and you and your pet are consumed by them. rip. </p>

                    <p class="IkeaTxt"> When you arrive, you are immedietly questioned by other people inside. "Are you okay?", "Are you here to help?", "Have you been bitten?". You guess other people had the same idea as you to take shelter here. After settling in and meeting the other survivors, a man steps up in front of the group and starts ordering tasks to others to do for "the good of the group". He seems confident but you can't shake this feeling that he's not that great a leader. What do you do about it?

                        You're probably just shaken up about the whole situation. No big deal. He looks like knows what he's doing..

                    <p> You've now spent around 2 weeks in the Ikea without being bothered by the outside world, but now the food supply is getting dangerously low. It should've lasted around 3 weeks longer than it did, but the man in charge had horded some of the food for himself. He begins to gather everyone to talk about this food shortage. "We must think about the good of the group.. which is why I am purposing that someone sacrifice themselves for the rest of us." He points at you. "That person doesn't look too important.. let's eat them! :D" Although the decision isn't unanimous, people aren't protesting very hard. They're hungry and exhausted.
                    </p>
                    <p class="badEnding"> Unfortunately you couldn't get away in time and the leader's men capture you. You are sentenced to a not so painless death by kitchen knife before being turned into human stew in the Ikea kitchen. rip. </p>

                    <p class="revoltTxt"> "Hey! who said you get to be in charge!?" You yell out from the back. "Uhh..I'm actually the manager of this place, I think I know what I'm doing.." he responds. Another person chimes in, "We're all equal here, you can't be telling us what to do!" The rest of the group nods in agreement and you can see the man get visibly nervous. "Hahaha.. I'm sure we can all come to an agreement, right? Ha-" Before he's able to finish his sentence a small group of people are pulling and pushing him towards the front door. He's thrown out and the door is chained up. </p>
                    <p class="goodEnding"> From there the group of survivors are able to build a community from the ground up using only the supplies in and around the building. Still in the middle of an apocolypse but now able to sustain yourselves! Congrats!</p>
